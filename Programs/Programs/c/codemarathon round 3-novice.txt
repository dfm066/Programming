1. Fraud Prime

	One commonly used method to calculate all primes in the range [2...n] is to start with the number 2, 
mark it as prime, and mark all its multiples(excluding itself) as not prime. Then, we find the next smallest 
unmaked number, mak it as prime, and mark all its multiples (excluding itself) as not prime. Continuing this
way, we get a list of all primes.
	Now,let us say that we modified the above algorithm, and stat with n instead of 2. e mark it as prime,
and mark all its factors(excluding itself) as not prime. Then We find the next greatest unmarked number, mark 
it as not prime, and mark all its factors(excluding itself) as not prime.Continuing this way, we get a list of all primes.
	Now you wonder, given a value of n, how many numbers are such that both the above algorithm will mark them as prime ?

i/p :- 6
o/p :- 1 	For invalid input print Invalid .

2. Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of m*n matrix U can move eithe right or down

i/p :- m=3,n=3
o/p :- 6

3. Inteeger array d contains n integers how many distinct ascending triples
	(d[i]<d[j]<d[k]),i<j<k)
ex :- 6
	1 1 2 2 3 4
o/p :- 4
